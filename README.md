C3PO Chrome extension
====

http://dict.bing.com.cn/ is a greate online translate tool which I use every single day.

However, I'm tired of the _select - copy - open a new tab - paste - press Enter_ process. So I write this chrome extension.

All you need to do is to select the text and right click your mouse, click C3PO, a new tab containing the translation will be created.

*I love C3PO as much as R2D2.*
